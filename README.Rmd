The goal of tinyPSA is to make it easier to process large amounts of csv data files produced from Particle Size Analysis output using Shiny interface. Fit specifically for The Sedimentary Records of Environmental Change Laboratory, Northern Arizona University.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tinyPSA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mzarowka/tinyPSA")
```

There are three main functions:

-   `tpsa_read()` - for reading multiple csv files.

-   `tpsa_gstat_populate()` for populating GRADISTAT.

-   `tpsa_gstat_read()` for cleaning GRADISTAT output.
